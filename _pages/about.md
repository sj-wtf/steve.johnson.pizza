# About Me

![me]({{ site.url }}/images/me.jpg)

I'm Steve Johnson.  I worked in traditional IT for about 2 years, then software support for about 4 years in varying capacities, now doing cloud operations/devops for a startup.  I grew up in Minnesota, and currently live in Minneapolis.  I am a beer snob and former avid cyclist, and tinker with Arduino projects in my free time.
