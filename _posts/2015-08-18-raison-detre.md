In my experience, interviews rarely allow the interviewer to accurately get an idea of an interviewee’s skills.  This may be because they’re not asking the right questions for whatever reason, or it could be because the style used by the interviewer doesn’t match up well with how the interviewee communicates.  There are a plethora of other reasons that I could list off, all of them boiling down to miscommunication.  So, the obvious solution to this problem is to communicate your skills clearly, concisely, and in as many ways as possible to mitigate the communication breakdowns that could occur.  I find that I communicate better in writing than verbally, since it allows more time for me to think of what I’m going to say (and edit how I say it) than a verbal discussion, and that I can refer back to my written conversations to recall what was previously stated, rather than having others spend time to jog my memory about what I said previously.  Others I know feel similarly; hence this blog.

I’m also notoriously bad at documenting my personal projects, meaning that when I drop them for a while and try to pick them back up, I end up basically going through the train of thought that I did when I originally started.  That’s time consuming and doesn’t have much of an upside.  I also figure that this could possibly benefit others who run into the same problems that I do.  I rely on blogs and Stack Overflow for a lot of things, so I figure there’s no reason not to give back.  Additionally, personal projects don’t usually make their way onto my resume, ’cause they’re not real work experience.
